Imagine being told as a young adult that the key to a successful life was just completing college and receiving a degree. Well, I found out that isn't the complete truth, success works best when you are doing work that you feel best applies your talent so that you can be the best version of you, that you can be! What do I mean? I graduated with a degree in Economics from The Florida State University, instead of pursuing a job in my field; I took the first job that was offered, this appeared to be the logical thing to do correct? Yes and no, to a broke college student, yes, its what I went to school for but in hindsight, the right answer is no. Now, how did I stumble across the amazing boot camp institution known as Flatiron, at my previous job, I was seeking something more to life and also to improve me financial situation, I mean lets be honest, if you work a job, you want to make sure that the most valuable commodity you're giving up, time, is at least in exchange for an amount of money you feel makes it worth it. While browsing the YouTube, I saw a video on how software engineering boot camp help this person lands a job without a college degree. I was immediately impressed and went on a search for the BEST boot camp program. That led me to Flatiron Boot camp. I was very impressed with the program outline, the concepts, skills, and flexibility of the program.

Why Data Science though, the world we live in today revolves around DATA. Every business in business must have the ability to process, store and interept data in order to maximize success. This particular skill set I felt would be the key to free me. What is Data Science, I asked myself, from all the definitions that I was presented with I came up with this; Data Science is a blend of various tools, algorithms, and machine learning principles with the goal to discover hidden patterns from the raw data. I found a visual to make it a little better to understand.

As you can see from the above image, a Data Analyst usually explains what is going on by processing history of the data. On the other hand, Data Scientist not only does the exploratory analysis to discover insights from it, but also uses various advanced machine-learning algorithms to identify the occurrence of a particular event in the future. A Data Scientist will look at the data from many angles, sometimes angles not known earlier.

So, Data Science is primarily used to make decisions and predictions making use of predictive causal analytics, prescriptive analytics (predictive plus decision science) and machine learning. Although, I am in a Data Science program, a Data Analyst is what I want to do. If you made it this far, thank you and maybe as more articles are written that demonstrate my mastery of Data Science, you will share a few of my post!
