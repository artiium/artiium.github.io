As a young Data Scientist, well a student of a few weeks. I can see that although I enjoyed the wonderful tedious labor of extracting data, there are those who just want to know, "What does all this mean". That's exactly what I am being paid to do. What's perfect visualization? This is the process of making advanced analysis and turning into easy-to-understand visualizations.

Researchers agree that we are dominated by our visual sense; in fact some estimate that between 80-85% of information we perceive, learn or process is mediated through vision. Data visualization is applied in almost every field of knowledge. Through computer models, presentations, and events the visual representation can be argued as the most crucial aspect of being a successful Data Scientist. To choose the most appropriate visualization technique you need to understand the data, its type and composition, what information you are trying to convey to your audience, and how viewers process visual information. So why is it important to us? Because of the way the human brain processes information, using charts or graphs to visualize large amounts of complex data is easier than poring over spreadsheets or reports. Data visualization is a quick, easy way to convey concepts in a universal manner – and you can experiment with different scenarios by making slight adjustments.

How do you decide what is the best visualization, well first you need to understand the data and what story should the data tell. We will explore some of the most common data visualization types.

Line Plot - The simplest technique, a line plot is used to plot the relationship or dependence of one variable on another.

Bar Chart - Bar charts are used for comparing the quantities of different categories or groups. Values of a category are represented with the help of bars and they can be configured with vertical or horizontal bars, with the length or height of each bar representing the value.

Histogram Plot - A histogram, representing the distribution of a continuous variable over a given interval or period of time, is one of the most frequently used data visualization techniques in machine learning. It plots the data by chunking it into intervals called ‘bins’.

Scatter Plot - Another common visualization techniques is a scatter plot that is a two-dimensional plot representing the joint variation of two data items. Scatter plots are used for examining the relationship, or correlations, between X and Y variables.

Box and Whisker Plot - A binned box plot with whiskers shows the distribution of large data and easily see outliers. In its essence, it is a graphical display of five statistics (the minimum, lower quartile, median, upper quartile and maximum) that summarizes the distribution of a set of data.
